Seven others were injured. The explosion occurred near a former police office occupied by the EPLC Wazalendo/CMC Nyatura militia, with a militia member suspected of mishandling the rocket (DRC35834).\n   - On the same day, an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted by suspected ADF militia detonated on the Matuna-Kambau stretch in Kambau (Bapere, Lubero), injuring three civilians who were returning from their fields (DRC35810).\n\n2. **Sud-Kivu Province:**\n   - On 15 May 2025, the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) conducted a drone strike on Twirwaneho bases in Mikenge (Itombwe, Mwenga).

The involvement of various armed groups, including the EPLC Wazalendo/CMC Nyatura and ADF militia, along with military operations by the FARDC, indicate a volatile security environment.

Around March 3, 2025, the SPLM-N-Abdelaziz, backed by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), took control of El Tibilab from the SPLM-N-Agar, which is allied with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). El Tibilab is located within the locality capital of Bau. The exact nature of the takeover remains unclear, as it is uncertain whether there were armed clashes during the transition of control (Event ID: 20250303-1).\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Location:** El Tibilab, Bau, Blue Nile, Sudan.\n- **Actors Involved:** SPLM-N-Abdelaziz, RSF, SPLM-N-Agar, SAF.\n- **Date:** Around March 3, 2025.\n- **Outcome:** SPLM-N-Abdelaziz and RSF gained control from SPLM-N-Agar.\n- **Uncertainty:** Whether clashes occurred during the takeover.\n\n**Implications:**\nThe takeover of El Tibilab by SPLM-N-Abdelaziz and RSF could indicate a broader power struggle in the Blue Nile region, potentially leading to further instability. The involvement of the RSF and the SAF-aligned SPLM-N-Agar suggests a complex web of alliances and rivalries that could escalate into larger conflicts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- **Monitoring:** Continue to monitor the situation in the Blue Nile region for any signs of escalating tensions or further territorial disputes.\n- **Diplomatic Engagement:** Engage with local and regional stakeholders to promote dialogue and de-escalation.\n- **Humanitarian Preparedness:** Prepare for potential humanitarian needs in the affected areas, including displacement and access to essential services.\n\nThis brief provides a concise overview of the key developments related to riots in Sudan in March 2025, focusing on the takeover of El Tibilab. Further analysis and monitoring are recommended to assess the broader implications and potential for conflict escalation.",
